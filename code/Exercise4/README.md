# Code of your exercise

Put here all the code created for this exercise

---

In order to test the code, you can use the following command:

```bash
& 'C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17\bin\java.exe' '@C:\Users\PC\AppData\Local\Temp\cp_2jrver21jq8p5h18v14kpnt75.argfile' 'fr.istic.vv.Main' ".\code\Exercise4\testExample\" ".\code\Exercise4\report.html"
```

The code file contained in this folder is just a copy of the one contained in the src/ folder.

When testing it on common-collection-master, we see that it has several hundred of 
private fields without public getters.
